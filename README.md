# A View of Egypt's Economic Situation (1991-2022)
Historical macroeconomic analysis of Egypt (1991–2022): Analysis and visualization in R

In this project, I explored Egypt's macroeconomic data from 1991 to 2022 to gain insights into various economic indicators such as unemployment rate, inflation trends, population growth, and their potential relationships.

**Methodology:** I followed an APPA-SA (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act) structured approach, including data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, and conclusion.

**Tools:** Microsoft Excel and R programming.
